  End-User License Agreement (EULA) Between The Things Industries and Customer
                          last revised August 9th, 2018

This End-User License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is between you and The Things
Industries (“TTI”). If you are agreeing to this Agreement not as an individual
but on behalf of your company, then “Customer” or “you” means your company, and
you are binding your company to this Agreement. TTI may modify this Agreement
from time to time, subject to the terms in Section 21 (Changes to this
Agreement) below.

1 Scope of the Agreement

  This Agreement governs your initial purchase as well as any future purchases
  made by you that reference this Agreement.

2 Types of TTI Products

  This Agreement governs (a) TTI’s commercially available downloadable software
  products (currently designated as "Private Cloud” or “On-premises”
  deployments) (“Software”), (b) TTI’s hosted or cloud-based solutions
  (currently designated as "SaaS" deployments) (“Hosted Services”), and (c) any
  related support or maintenance services provided by TTI. Software and Hosted
  Services, together with related Documentation, are referred to as “Products”.
  The Products and their permitted use are further described in TTI’s standard
  documentation (“Documentation”). Section 5 (Software Terms) applies
  specifically to Software, and Section 6 (Hosted Services Terms) applies
  specifically to Hosted Services, but unless otherwise specified, other
  provisions of this Agreement apply to all Products.

3 Orders

  3.1 Directly with TTI
    TTI’s Product ordering documentation or purchase flow (“Order”) will specify
    your authorized scope of use for the Products, which may include: (a) number
    and type of Device Bundles (as defined below), (b) number of deployment
    regions (for Hosted Services), (c) numbers of licenses, copies or instances
    (for Software), (d) the Authorized User (as defined below), or (e) other
    restrictions or billable units (as applicable, the “Scope of Use”). The term
    “Order”also includes any applicable Product or Support and Maintenance
    renewal, or purchases you make to increase or upgrade your Scope of Use.

  3.2 Reseller Orders
    This Agreement applies whether you purchase our Products directly from TTI
    or through TTI “Service Providers” or other authorized resellers (each, a
    “Reseller”). If you purchase through a Reseller, your Scope of Use shall be
    as stated in the Reseller Order placed by Reseller for you and Reseller is
    responsible for the accuracy of any such Order. Resellers are not authorized
    to make any promises or commitments on TTI’s behalf, and we are not bound by
    any obligations to you other than what we specify in this Agreement.

  3.3 Registration information
    Any registration information you provide to us as part of an Order must be
    accurate, current and complete. You must also update your information so
    that we may send notices, statements and other information to you by email
    or through your account. You are responsible for all actions taken through
    your accounts.

4 Device Bundles and Authorized Users

  Device Bundles specify the maximum number of End Nodes (commonly known as
  Connected Devices) to be registered in the Product.

  Only the specific number of individuals for whom you have paid the required
  fees and whom you designate through the applicable Product (“Authorized
  Users”) may access and use the Products. Authorized Users may be you or your
  employees, representatives, consultants, contractors, agents, or other third
  parties who are acting for your benefit or on your behalf. You may also permit
  your customers to have limited access to certain Products as Authorized Users.
  You are responsible for compliance with this Agreement by all Authorized
  Users. All use of Products by you and your Authorized Users must be within the
  Scope of Use and solely for the benefit of you.

  You may increase the number of Device Bundles and Authorized Users permitted
  by placing a new Order.

5 Software Terms

  5.1 Your License Rights
    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, TTI grants you a
    non-exclusive, non- sublicensable and non-transferable license to install
    and use the Software during the applicable License Term in accordance with
    this Agreement, your applicable Scope of Use, and the Documentation. The
    term of each Software license (“License Term”) will be specified in your
    Order. Your License Term will end upon any termination of this Agreement,
    even if it is identified as “perpetual” or if no expiration date is
    specified in your Order. The Software requires a license key in order to
    operate, which will be delivered as described in Section 8.2 (Delivery).

  5.2 Number of Instances
    Unless otherwise specified in your Order, for each Software license that you
    purchase, you may install one production instance of the Software on systems
    owned or operated by you (or your third party service providers so long as
    you remain responsible for their compliance with the terms and conditions of
    this Agreement). We may also make available “developer” licenses free of
    charge for certain of our Software offerings to allow you to deploy
    non-production instances, such as for staging or QA purposes. Details for
    how to request non-production licenses are available on request.

  5.3 Third Party Code
    The Software may include code and libraries licensed to us by third parties,
    including open source software.

6 Hosted Services Terms

  6.1 Access to Hosted Services
    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, TTI grants you a
    non-exclusive right to access and use the Hosted Services during the
    applicable Subscription Term (as defined below) in accordance with this
    Agreement, your applicable Scope of Use and the Documentation. You
    acknowledge that our Hosted Services are on-line, subscription-based
    products and that we may make changes to the Hosted Services from time to
    time.

  6.2 Availability
    The Hosted Services will be available as per the details in the Service
    Level Agreement (Exhibit A) for each calendar month of the Subscription
    Term. Downtime as a result of any causes beyond the control of TTI or that
    are not reasonably foreseeable by TTI, including, without limitation by any
    of the events noted below are excluded from the Availability calculations
    ("Excused Outages"):

      i) Customer environment issues affecting connectivity or interfering with
      the Services, including without limitation, Customer's telecommunications
      connection or any other Customer software or equipment, Customer's
      firewall software, hardware or security settings, Customer's configuration
      of anti-virus software or anti-spyware or malware software, or operator
      error of Customer; ii) Any third party software, hardware, or
      telecommunication failures, including Internet slow- downs or failures;
      iii) Issues related to third party domain name system (DNS) errors or
      failures; iv) Scheduled maintenance of the Services, conducted on a
      regular basis, for which TTI will make a best effort to give Customer a
      minimum of five (5) business days advanced notice; v) Emergency
      maintenance of the Services, not to exceed four (2) hours in any month,
      for which Customer may not receive advanced notice. However, TTI strives
      to notify Customer immediately in case of emergency maintenance.

    In the event TTI fails to achieve the Availability requirement, TTI will use
    commercially reasonable efforts to correct the interruption as promptly as
    practicable. In the event TTI fails to achieve the Availability requirement
    in three (3) consecutive months during the term of this Agreement, Customer
    may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect after the third
    consecutive month, without further obligation and receive a prorated refund
    of any pre-paid, unused recurring fees. The refund will constitute
    Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and TTI's sole and exclusive liability
    for failure to achieve the Availability requirement.

  6.3 Subscription Terms and Renewals

    Hosted Services are provided on a subscription basis for a set term
    specified in your Order (“Subscription Term”). Subscriptions will
    automatically renew for periods equal to your initial Subscription Term as
    specified in your Order (“Renewal Term”) (and you will be charged at the
    then- current rates) unless you cancel your subscription. If you cancel,
    your subscription will terminate at the end of then-current billing cycle,
    but you will not be entitled to any credits or refunds for amounts accrued
    or paid prior to such termination.

  6.4 Your Data

    “Your Data” means any data, content, code, video, images or other materials
    of any type that you upload, submit or otherwise transmit to or through
    Hosted Services. You will retain all right, title and interest in and to
    Your Data in the form provided to TTI. Subject to the terms of this
    Agreement, you hereby grant to TTI a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
    right to (a) collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify and create
    derivative works of Your Data, in each case solely to the extent necessary
    to provide the applicable Hosted Service to you and (b) collect, use, copy,
    distribute, and otherwise exploit statistical and other aggregated data
    derived from your use of the Hosted Services ("Aggregated Data") for TTI's
    business purposes, including the provision of products and services to TTI's
    customers; provided the Aggregated Data is combined with similar data from
    TTI's other customers and does not include any information identifying
    Customer or any identifiable individual. The Aggregated Data will not be
    considered your Confidential Information.

  6.5 Security

    TTI implements security procedures to help protect Your Data from security
    attacks. However, you understand that use of the Hosted Services necessarily
    involves transmission of Your Data over networks that are not owned,
    operated or controlled by us, and we are not responsible for any of Your
    Data lost, altered, intercepted or stored across such networks. We cannot
    guarantee that our security procedures will be error-free, that
    transmissions of Your Data will always be secure or that unauthorized third
    parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or those of our
    third party service providers.

  6.6 Data retention Limits

    There may be data retention limits associated with a particular Hosted
    Service. These limits are described in the services descriptions on our
    websites or in the Documentation for the particular Hosted Service.

  6.7 Responsibility for Your Data

    6.7.1 General
      You ensure that your use of Hosted Services and all Your Data is at all
      times compliant with all applicable local, state, federal and
      international laws and regulations (“Laws”). You represent and warrant
      that: (i) you have obtained all necessary rights, releases and permissions
      to provide all Your Data to TTI and to grant the rights granted to TTI in
      this Agreement and (ii) Your Data and its transfer to and use by TTI as
      authorized by you under this Agreement do not violate any Laws or rights
      of any third party, including without limitation any intellectual property
      rights, rights of privacy, or rights of publicity, and any use, collection
      and disclosure authorized herein is not inconsistent with the terms of any
      applicable privacy policies. Other than its security obligations under
      Section 6.5 (Security), TTI assumes no responsibility or liability for
      Your Data, and you shall be solely responsible for Your Data and the
      consequences of using, disclosing, storing, or transmitting it.

    6.7.2 Indemnity for Your Data
      You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless TTI from and against any
      loss, cost, liability or damage, including attorneys’ fees, for which TTI
      becomes liable arising from or relating to any claim relating to Your
      Data, including but not limited to any claim brought by a third party
      alleging that Your Data, or your use of the Hosted Services in breach of
      this Agreement, infringes the intellectual property rights of a third
      party or violates applicable law.

    6.7.3 Deletion at End of Subscription Term
      We may remove or delete Your Data within a reasonable period of time after
      the termination of your Subscription Term.

7 Support and Maintenance

  TTI will provide the support and maintenance services for the Products
  described in and subject to the Service Level Agreement (exhibit A) (“Support
  and Maintenance”) during the period for which you have paid the applicable
  fees. The TTI Service Level Agreement may be modified by TTI from time to time
  to reflect process improvements or changing practices. Support and Maintenance
  for Software includes access to New Releases, if and when available. You may
  use any New Releases that we provide to you during a valid support term in the
  same way that you use Software, and New Releases are included in the
  definition of Software in that case. “New Releases” are bug fixes, patches,
  major or minor releases, or any other changes, enhancements, or modifications
  to the Software that we make generally commercially available.

8 Returns and Financial Terms

  8.1 Return Policy
    As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction, it is our customary
    business practice to allow customers to return a Product within 30 days of
    payment for any reason or no reason and to receive a refund of the amount
    paid for the returned Product. In the context of Software, a return means
    that we will disable the license key that allowed the Software to operate.
    In the context of Hosted Services, a return means that we will disable
    access to the Hosted Service. We will not accept returns after the 30-day
    return period. You understand that TTI may change this practice in the
    future in accordance with Section 21 (Changes to this Agreement).

  8.2 Delivery
    We will deliver the applicable license keys (in the case of Software) or
    login instructions (in the case of Hosted Services) to the email addresses
    specified in your Order when we have received payment of the applicable
    fees. All deliveries under this Agreement will be electronic. For the
    avoidance of doubt, you are responsible for installation of any Software,
    and you acknowledge that TTI has no further delivery obligation with respect
    to the Software after delivery of the license keys.

  8.3 Payment
    You agree to pay all fees in accordance with each Order. Unless otherwise
    specified in your Order, you will pay all amounts in Euros at the time you
    place your Order. Other than as expressly set forth in Section 8.1 (Return
    Policy) and Section 16 (IP Indemnification by TTI), all amounts are non-
    refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable. If you add or change the type
    of Device Bundles during your License Term or Subscription Term, we will
    charge you for the increased number of Device Bundles pursuant to the
    then-currently applicable rates in your next billing cycle. You agree that
    we may bill your credit card or execute direct debit orders for renewals,
    additional users, and unpaid fees, as applicable. If you purchase any
    Products through a Reseller, you owe payment to the Reseller as agreed
    between you and the Reseller, but you acknowledge that we may terminate your
    rights to use Products if we do not receive our corresponding payment from
    the Reseller.

  8.4 Taxes
    Your payments under this Agreement exclude any taxes or duties payable in
    respect of the Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made
    or received. To the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by TTI,
    you must pay to TTI the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any
    fees owed under this Agreement.

9 No-Charge Products

  We may offer certain Products to you at no charge, including free accounts,
  trial use, and access to Beta Versions as defined below (“No-Charge
  Products”). Your use of No-Charge Products is subject to any additional terms
  that we specify and is only permitted for the period designated by us. You may
  not use No-Charge Products for competitive analysis or similar purposes. We
  may terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at any time and for any
  reason in our sole discretion, without liability to you. You understand that
  any pre-release and beta products we make available (“Beta Versions”) are
  still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to
  contain more errors and bugs than generally available Products. We make no
  promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available. All
  information regarding the characteristics, features or performance of Beta
  Versions constitutes TTI’s Confidential Information. To the maximum extent
  permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with
  respect to No-Charge Products, including any Support and Maintenance,
  warranty, and indemnity obligations.

10 Restrictions

  Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not: (a)
  rent, lease, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works of, distribute,
  sell, sublicense, transfer, or provide access to the Products to a third
  party, (b) interfere with any license key mechanism in the Products or
  otherwise circumvent mechanisms in the Products intended to limit your use,
  (c) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to
  obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats
  or non-public APIs to any Products, except as permitted by law, (d) remove or
  obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in any Product, or (e)
  publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Products.

11 Your Development of Add-Ons

  11.1 License to Developer Guides
    From time to time, TTI may publish SDK’s or API’s and associated guidelines
    (“Developer Guides”) to allow you to develop plugins, extensions, add-ons or
    other software products or services that interoperate or are integrated with
    the Products (“Add-Ons”). You may distribute your Add-Ons to third parties,
    but only for those Products permitted by TTI, and only in accordance with
    the Developer Guides.

  11.2 Conditions to Development of Add-Ons
    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, TTI has no
    support, warranty, indemnification or other obligation or liability with
    respect to your Add-Ons or their combination, interaction or use with the
    Products. You shall indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against
    any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses out of
    or in connection with any claim brought against us by a third party relating
    to your Add-Ons (including but not limited to any representations or
    warranties you make about your Add-Ons) or your breach of this Section.

12 Ownership and Feedback

  Products are made available on a limited license or access basis, and no
  ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms such as
  “purchase” or “sale”. TTI and its licensors have and retain all right, title
  and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the
  Products (including all No-Charge Products), their “look and feel”, any and
  all related or underlying technology, and any modifications or derivative
  works of the foregoing created by or for TTI, including without limitation as
  they may incorporate Feedback (“TTI Technology”). From time to time, you may
  choose to submit comments, information, questions, data, ideas, description of
  processes, or other information to TTI, including in the course of receiving
  Support and Maintenance (“Feedback”). TTI may in connection with any of its
  products or services freely use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and
  exploit any Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or
  restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. No Feedback
  will be considered your Confidential Information, and nothing in this
  Agreement limits TTI’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or
  market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

13 Confidentiality

  Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each party agrees that all
  code, inventions, know- how, business, technical and financial information
  disclosed to such party (“Receiving Party”) by the disclosing party
  ("Disclosing Party") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing
  Party ("Confidential Information"), provided that it is identified as
  confidential at the time of disclosure.

  Any TTI Technology and any performance information relating to the Products
  shall be deemed Confidential Information of TTI without any marking or further
  designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will
  hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information. The
  Receiving Party's nondisclosure obligation shall not apply to information
  which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession
  or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or
  has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is
  rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach
  of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by
  employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information. The
  Receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information if so required
  pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent
  required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to
  the Disclosing Party). The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of
  Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone
  would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure
  by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to appropriate
  equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.
  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section shall not operate as a separate
  warranty with respect to the operation of any Product.

14 Term and Termination

  This Agreement is in effect for as long as you have a valid License Term or
  Subscription Term (the “Term”), unless sooner terminated as permitted in this
  Agreement. Either party may terminate this Agreement before the expiration of
  the Term if the other party materially breaches any of the terms of this
  Agreement and does not cure the breach within thirty (30) days after written
  notice of the breach. Either party may also terminate the Agreement before the
  expiration of the Term if the other party ceases to operate, declares
  bankruptcy, or becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to meet its financial
  obligations. You may terminate this Agreement at any time with notice to TTI,
  but you will not be entitled to any credits or refunds as a result of
  convenience termination for prepaid but unused Software, Hosted Services
  subscriptions, or Support and Maintenance. Except where an exclusive remedy
  may be specified in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any
  remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies
  it may have under this Agreement, by law, or otherwise. Once the Agreement
  terminates, you (and your Authorized Users) will no longer have any right to
  use or access any Products, or any information or materials that we make
  available to you under this Agreement, including TTI Confidential Information.
  You are required to delete any of the foregoing from your systems as
  applicable (including any third party systems operated on your behalf) and
  provide written certification to us that you have done so at our request. The
  following provisions will survive any termination or expiration of this
  Agreement: Sections 6.7.2 (Indemnity for Your Data), 8.3 (Payment), 8.4
  (Taxes), 9 (No-Charge Products) (disclaimers and use restrictions only), 10

    FAILURES AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC
    COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF TTI. TO
    THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER TTI NOR ANY OF ITS THIRD PARTY
    SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE AS TO THE
    RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, QUALITY, SUITABILITY, TRUTH, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY

    THEREWITH, OR THAT: (A) THE USE OF ANY PRODUCTS WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY,
    UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; (B) THE PRODUCTS WILL OPERATE IN COMBINATION
    WITH ANY OTHER HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEM, OR DATA; (C) THE PRODUCTS (OR ANY

    OR INACCURATE DATA, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF

    THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT
    LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES
    IN ADVANCE. NEITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER SHALL EXCEED
    THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO US FOR PRODUCTS AND SUPPORT AND
    MAINTENANCE IN THE 12 MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE CLAIM. THIS SECTION
    15.3 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) SHALL NOT APPLY TO (1) AMOUNTS OWED BY YOU
    UNDER ANY ORDERS, (2) EITHER PARTY’S EXPRESS INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN
    THIS AGREEMENT, OR (3) YOUR BREACH OF SECTION 10 (RESTRICTIONS). TO THE
    MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NO SUPPLIERS OF ANY THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS

    The parties agree that the limitations specified in this Section 15.3
    (Limitation of Liability) will survive and apply even if any limited remedy
    specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential
    purpose.

16 IP Indemnification by TTI

  We will defend you against any claim brought against you by a third party
  alleging that a Product, when used as authorized under this Agreement,
  infringes a United States or European Union patent or registered copyright (a
  “Claim”), and we will indemnify you and hold you harmless against any damages
  and costs finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to
  settlement by TTI (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of a
  Claim, provided that we have received from you: (a) prompt written notice of
  the claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for us to respond
  without prejudice); (b) reasonable assistance in the defense and investigation
  of the claim, including providing us a copy of the claim and all relevant
  evidence in your possession, custody or control; and (c) the exclusive right
  to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement (if
  applicable) of the claim. If your use of a Product is (or in our opinion is
  likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement, or if we determine such
  actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, we may, at our
  option and in our discretion: (i) procure a license for your continued use of
  the Product in accordance with this Agreement; (ii) substitute a substantially
  functionally similar Product; or (iii) terminate your right to continue using
  the Product and refund, in the case of Software, the license fee paid by you
  as reduced to reflect a three year straight-line depreciation from the license
  purchase date, and in the case of a Hosted Service, any prepaid amounts for
  the terminated portion of the Subscription Term.

  TTI’s indemnification obligations above do not apply: (1) if the total
  aggregate fees received by TTI with respect to your license to Software or
  subscription to Hosted Services in the 12 month period immediately preceding
  the claim is less than US$50,000; (2) if the Product is modified by any party
  other than TTI, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by
  such modification; (3) if the Product is used in combination with any non-TTI
  product, software or equipment, but solely to the extent the alleged
  infringement is caused by such combination; (4) to unauthorized use of
  Products; (5) to any Claim arising as a result of (y) Your Data (or
  circumstances covered by your indemnification obligations in Section 6.7.2
  (Indemnity for Your Data)) or (z) any third-party deliverables or components
  contained with the Products; (6) to any unsupported release of the Software;
  or (7) if you settle or make any admissions with respect to a claim without
  TTI’s prior written consent. THIS SECTION 16 (IP INDEMNIFICATION BY TTI)
  STATES OUR SOLE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT OF
  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PRODUCT OR OTHER ITEMS
  PROVIDED BY TTI UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

17 Third Party Vendor Products

  TTI or third parties may from time to time make available to you (e.g.,
  through the TTI Marketplace or TTI Integrations) third-party products or
  services, including but not limited to add-ons and plugins as well as
  implementation, customization, training, and other consulting services. If you
  procure any of these third party products or services, you do so under a
  separate agreement (and exchange of data) solely between you and the third
  party vendor. TTI does not warrant or support non-TTI products or services,
  whether or not they are designated by TTI as “verified” or otherwise, and
  disclaims all liability for such products or services.

18 Publicity Rights

  20.1 Dispute Resolution; Arbitration
    In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
    Agreement, the parties hereto shall consult and negotiate with each other
    and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a solution
    satisfactory to both parties. If the parties do not reach settlement within
    a period of 60 days, any unresolved controversy or claim arising out of or
    relating to this Agreement shall proceed to binding arbitration under the
    Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. The parties
    shall seek to mutually appoint an arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on
    a single arbitrator, then there shall be three (3) arbitrators: one selected
    by each party, and a third selected by the first two. Arbitration will take
    place in one of the following cities as mutually agreed between the parties:
    London (UK), Amsterdam (Netherlands) or San Francisco, CA (USA). If the
    parties are unable to agree to one of these cities, then the arbitration
    shall proceed in Amsterdam. All negotiations and arbitration proceedings
    pursuant to this Section will be confidential and treated as compromise and
    settlement negotiations for purposes of all similar rules and codes of
    evidence of applicable legislation and jurisdictions. The language of the
    arbitration shall be English.

  set to auto-renew.

  networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government agency. You may
